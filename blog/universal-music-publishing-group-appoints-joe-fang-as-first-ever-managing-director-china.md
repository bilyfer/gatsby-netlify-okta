Said Fang: “I am from a music family but never imagined having the incredible opportunity of working for Universal Music Publishing. Since I’ve taken the job, I’ve seen so much excitement in the eyes of local musicians and songwriters after they really understood what a true music publisher can do for them. China needs UMPG, just as UMPG needs China.”
