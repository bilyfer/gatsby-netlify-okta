LOS ANGELES, May 20, 2020 – Today, Motown Records launched The ABC Initiative – a multi-faceted campaign focused on helping communities navigate the fundamentals of life in these unusual times. The hashtag #MotownABCs reflects how living life under quarantine has forced people to get back to basics. Over a 13-week period, the label will unveil compelling social media content to entertain, inform and inspire Motown’s followers. Tied to the alphabet, topics will include everything from Action, Fake News and Jobs to Nurses, Side Hustles and Xenophobia. Fans can Quarantine With QC (Quality Control Music), download custom coloring page printables and more.

The boots on the ground, real life components of The ABC Initiative will bring immediate, tangible aid to the hungry, small business owners and others who are particularly vulnerable in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic..

Ethiopia Habtemariam, President of Motown Records and Executive Vice President of Capitol Music Group, says, “Motown is a label that was birthed in community and has always led by example. #MotownABCs will uplift our artists and their work, other creators, Black and Brown-owned businesses and various non-profit relief efforts. At the heart of this campaign is what is at the very heart of our label: being an unfaltering pillar of strength for our community in times of levity and in times of crisis.”

\#MotownABCs highlights include:

· Heritage grants – In 1959, Berry Gordy secured an $800 loan that enabled him to found Motown Records. In 2020, 25 Black and Brown-owned businesses will each receive an $800 gift from Motown to help support their operations during these financially challenging times.

· Motown will fund 100,000 meals for families and individuals in need via a donation made to Feeding America.

· Via a donation to #HashtagLunchbag, Motown will subsidize 2,800 meals for children in need living in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.

· Families can access custom coloring page printables featuring classic and current Motown artists, created by Black visual artist Laci Jordan.

The ABC Initiative was created by and will be executed by Inside Projects, a Los Angeles-based creative agency led by two Black women.
